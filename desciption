In this project making of data profile use of grids,flex box and divs was used.
The grid was use to organise the bigger boxes in which use of divs occured.
The grid contains various divisions which contains heading,image and even the paragraphs.
After using grid for above 2 boxes another grid was used for rest of the 4 boxes.After making the abbove mentioned grids both parent grids were included in flex box.
Then the flex box was used to design further.
The headings and the para's were included inside the divisions.These div's were moved by making its position relative w.r.t to itself,
with proper styling using css these were moved 
from right/bottom to left/top.
Nested divisions were used to place paragraphs and heading on the respective divisions.
The meta character_set used was UTF-8;
